# How to avoid Scams! Must read for beginners!

1. **Fake wallets** – Only download Cardano wallets from trusted sources:

Daedalus Desktop wallet : [https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/](https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/)

yoroi mobile wallet :  [https://emurgo.io/our-products\#yoroi](https://emurgo.io/our-products#yoroi)

2. **Telegram** – When joining some crypto groups you will get private messages instantly from scammers trying to get your crypto. They will pose as admins or support members from the group. Don’t even waste your time with them as admins in Cardano especially will never message you first. Scammers create accounts that look like admins.

Edit your Telegram settings:

```text
Go to ''privacy and security''
Then ''Groups & channels''
Change Groupe invite settings to ''My contacts''
```

2**. Giveaway scams** – Nobody will ever double your crypto by you sending them an amount to get        double back. There are **no Giveaways or Airdrops** Videos on YouTube showing Charles Hoskinson and any  other high profile people in crypto giving away free crypto are **all fake!**
