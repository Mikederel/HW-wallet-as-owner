# How to avoid Scams. Must read for beginners!

**1. Fake wallets** – Only download Cardano wallets from trusted sources:

Daedalus Desktop wallet : [https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/](https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/)

yoroi mobile wallet :  [https://emurgo.io/our-products\#yoroi](https://emurgo.io/our-products#yoroi)

{% hint style="warning" %}
`There are currently no Android or iOS versions of Daedalus wallet.`
{% endhint %}

**2. Telegram** – When joining some crypto groups you will get private messages instantly from scammers trying to get your crypto. They will pose as admins or support members from the group. Don’t even waste your time with them as admins in Cardano especially will never message you first. Scammers create accounts that look like admins.

Edit your Telegram settings:

```text
Go to : 
''privacy and security''
then  : 
''Groups & channels''
and change :
''Groupe invite settings'' to ''My contacts''.
```

**3. Giveaway scams** – Nobody will ever double your crypto by you sending them an amount to get        double back. There are _**no Giveaways or Airdrops**_ Videos on YouTube showing Charles Hoskinson and any  other high profile people in crypto giving away free crypto are _**all fake!**_

**4. Password/Passphrase** – Do not share your password, passphrase, or secrets folders with anyone. Report people who ask you to do this to [report@Cardano.org.](mailto:report@Cardano.org)

**5. YouTube Comments** – All whatsapp numbers or twitter links to investors channels \(fund managers\) from copies of a youtuber's account are from scammers. Name looks the same, but real comments from the channel owners name have a dark background.
